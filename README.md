# UnityMap

UnityMap is a simple web project created for the Hack4Unity online hackathon on Devpost.

Its goal is to promote unity and community support by allowing users to add “Help Points” on a map.  
Each Help Point represents someone offering support such as:
- food donations  
- tutoring  
- pet care  
- community activities  
- or any helpful act  

This project encourages a more unified and connected world.
